# About Myself
Hello folks, Edward Deng here.

All the code created here is to make my research work convenient. <br/>
Or for my own interest. <br/>
I don't have a specific coding language preference, and I just use what is necessary.

Currently, I'm finishing my Master's thesis and applying to PhD position.<br/>
Research field: magnesium alloy, corrosion protection, fuel cell (current research work), etc. 

Equipment: 
- Microsoft Surface Pro (2017), Dell XPS15 9560, <br/>
- Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, <br/>
- Google Pixel 3 64GB <br/>
