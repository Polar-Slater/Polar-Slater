# About Myself
Hello folks, Edward Deng here.

All the code created here is to make my research work convenient. <br/>
Or for my own interest. <br/>
I don't have a specific coding language preference, and I just use whatever is necessary.

I just start my PhD study.<br/>
Research field: oxygen evolution reaction(current research), magnesium alloy, corrosion protection, fuel cell , etc.
